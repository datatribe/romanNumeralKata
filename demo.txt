<html><h1>Arabic to Roman Numeral Conversion</h1>
<p>The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in
ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers
throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers in
this system are represented by combinations of letters from the
Latin alphabet. Roman numerals, as used today, are based on
seven symbols:</p>
<br>
<pre>I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500 and M = 1,000</pre>
<br>
<p>Try it yourself - enter a value in either field and press Enter
to see its counterpart.</p></html>
